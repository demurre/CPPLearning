For x changing from a to b with a step (𝑏-𝑎)/𝑘 , where 𝑘 = 10, calculate
the value of the function 𝑦, which is given by the analytical formula 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) and
by the power series expansion 𝑆 = {𝑠𝑛}. Calculate the “exact” value of 𝑦exact
using the analytical formula and the approximate value 𝑦tab . The approximate value should be found
in two ways:

- as the sum of the 𝑛 first terms of the series 𝑆 for a given 𝑛;
- as the sum of the series 𝑆 for a given accuracy 𝑒 (𝑒 = 0.0001). The accuracy limits
  the number of terms in the series: the series continues until the condition
  |𝑠𝑛| ≤ 𝑒. In this case, the number of members of the series 𝑛 in total is not fixed from the very beginning and will be determined automatically under
  from the beginning and will be determined automatically during the calculation.
  For each value of x and each method of approximate calculation of the function
  determine the relative error 𝜀: 𝜀 = |y precise-y approach/y precise|

The work should develop an information system designed to store
and organizing access to information about a given entity. The entity has one
numeric parameter and two text parameters, one of which is unique and is used
as an entity identifier. The system is based on a tiered architecture
(presentation, business logic, data layers). The system interface is text-based (TUI), based on
based on a selection menu. Interaction with the user takes place in REPL mode.
The data layer is organized on the basis of the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern and its implementation.
(DAO) design pattern and its implementation is based on a collection.

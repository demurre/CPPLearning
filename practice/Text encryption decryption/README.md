## Task: 1. Reading text from a previously prepared text file (input.txt)
## 2. Output of the read text to the screen (console).
## 3. Entering the key for text encryption.
## 4. Encrypting the read text, outputting it to the screen and to an external file (output.txt).
## 5. Encryption must be reversible, that is, applying the same key to the encrypted text must result in the original text being obtained.
## 6. Encryption should be implemented using the Caesar cipher (the length of the key is specified by the user).
## Result:

## 1. Using the guidelines, develop a C++ program that contains 6 variables of the same type and 2 pointers to any of these variables.
## 2. Display on the screen: 
### The size (number of bytes) allocated for variables and pointers;
### Values of variables; 
### Values of pointers; 
### Addresses in the OP of all variables; 
### Addresses in the OP of all pointers; 
### The result of subtracting pointers; 
## 3. Perform operations on the pointers: 
### Adding pointers with an integer; 
### Subtraction from the pointer of an integer; 
### Decrement;
### Increment; 
### Relationship operations: ==, <=, <, >, >=, !=; 
### Display the results of operations on the screen; 
## 4. Create a pointer to the pointer and display on the screen:
### Address in the OP of this pointer;
### The value of this pointer;
## 5. Create an undefined pointer and use it to point to any of the previously declared variables. Display the value of this pointer on the screen.
